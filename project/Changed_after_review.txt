- SimpleImputer(strategy="mean") -> SimpleImputer(strategy="median")
- Added hypothesis for normall age distribution check
- Added QQ plot for age distribution to check normality
- Checked age association with transported, using Spearman's Rank Correlation with
hypothesis
- Changed cross-validation place to the part of dataset would be used
- In randomizedsearchcv changed to KFold_cv instead of stratified
- Removed stratifiend_kfold_cv results since it's not needed
- Added docstrings to created functions in project
- For spearman's correlation binary features were removed
